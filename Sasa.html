            <p>Sunday, one word, infinite meanings,</p>
            <p>The day that Jesus arose,</p>
            <p>A day of rest and companionship,</p>
            <p>The end of the week to some, and the start of it to others,</p>
            <p>But my favourite meaning of it is you.</p>
            <p>You remind me of what it means to love, and to be loved.</p>
            <p>For today, I hope you stay long enough to watch the world mirror the love you put into it.</p>
            <p>Wishing you a birthday as special as you are, and may you know how much you’re loved in each and every way.</p>
            <p>And like the sun, may your days get brighter every year,</p>
            <p>For God’s gifts are beautiful, and you are the most beautiful one.</p>
